# üß† Prompts and Answers: Strategic Exploration ‚Äì Phase 2

This document contains advanced strategic prompts submitted to the LLM during the second phase of Research Task 5. These go beyond factual retrieval and test the model's ability to reason using performance data.

## ‚ùì Q1: Which player should Syracuse prioritize for draw control training to enhance possession in 2022?

**LLM Response**: Ella Simkins led the team with 88 draw controls. She consistently dominated possession after goals and was key in transitions. Training her further could help Syracuse increase first possessions and set the pace early in games.

**Evaluation**: ‚úÖ Strong answer. The LLM used correct stats and linked draw control dominance to strategic advantages.

## ‚ùì Q2: Which game had the highest performance volatility and what can we learn from it?

**LLM Response**: The 6‚Äì17 loss to North Carolina showed a deviation of 11 goals ‚Äî the largest margin against Syracuse. This suggests that against top-ranked teams, Syracuse struggled both offensively and defensively. Reviewing defensive errors and possession control in this game may help reduce volatility.

**Evaluation**: ‚úÖ Correct margin identified. The LLM offered strategic insights without prompting, which shows solid interpretive reasoning.

## ‚ùì Q3: Does high crowd attendance lead to better performance?

**LLM Response**: Syracuse‚Äôs largest crowd was 5,405 during the national championship loss to Boston College. However, other high-attendance games like the 19‚Äì17 win over Boston College (517) suggest some positive correlation. The LLM noted that without more consistent attendance data, any relationship remains speculative.

**Evaluation**: ‚ö† Partial. The LLM provided relevant examples but didn‚Äôt quantify correlation or test the hypothesis with data.

## ‚ùì Q4: In games decided by 2 goals or fewer, who delivered the strongest offensive performance?

**LLM Response**: Meaghan Tyrrell frequently appeared in tight matchups with multi-goal games, including the 16‚Äì14 and 19‚Äì17 games. Her ability to perform under pressure made her the most effective clutch player.

**Evaluation**: ‚úÖ Solid judgment. The model inferred performance in close games based on known top scorers and match context.

---

## ‚ùì Q5: Based on combined defensive metrics, who was Syracuse‚Äôs most impactful defender?

**LLM Response**: Sarah Cooper had 48 ground balls and 33 caused turnovers, making her a defensive cornerstone. Her consistency in disrupting plays and recovering possession positions her as the best overall defender.

**Evaluation**: ‚úÖ Accurate. The LLM applied multiple statistics and drew a reliable conclusion.

---

## ‚ùì Q6: Should Syracuse be concerned about the number of free-position goals allowed?

**LLM Response**: Yes. Syracuse allowed 57 free-position goals, which accounted for over 27% of total goals conceded. Reducing fouls in critical scoring zones could directly improve win margins.

**Evaluation**: ‚úÖ Precise. The LLM calculated proportions and tied it to defensive discipline, showing actionable strategy.

---

## ‚ùì Q7: Who contributed meaningfully in both offense and defense?

**LLM Response**: Emma Tyrrell had 42 goals, 16 assists, 43 ground balls, and 23 caused turnovers. This two-way contribution makes her a versatile and valuable player in transition plays.

**Evaluation**: ‚úÖ Well-supported. The LLM selected the correct player and backed it up with multi-category statistics.
